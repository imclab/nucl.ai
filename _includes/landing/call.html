            <p>The 7th edition of the conference remains focused on practical applications of AI in creative industries. Less hype, more results!  We welcome submissions for presentations about AI techniques used in commercial products, ranging from independent games to mobile applications or AAA titles and simulations, even interactive exhibits. Post-mortems and technology specific tutorials about R&amp;D are also more than welcome, as well as participation for discussions and panels.  Out of experience, the best sessions at the event try to balanced design and technology &mdash; and both are of course welcome in 2015.</p>
