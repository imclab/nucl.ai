    Portraying characters is one of the most challenging aspects of building an
    engaging 3D world.  While many low-level aspects of character animation technology
    have been resolved, there are many questions that remain open as the industry
    pushes towards more procedural blend trees.  How should gestures be controlled by
    AI?  What's a way to maintain believable yet flexible locomotion?  For developers
    building simulations or games that rely heavily on characters, this track is 
    intended for you!
