- title: "Drivatar and Machine Learning Racing Skills in the Forza Series"
  description: >
    The Forza Drivatar technology powering games in the Forza Horizon and Forza Motorsport series
    is based on machine learning. It enables gameplay beyond robotic drivers and ghost replays by
    learning player- and style-specific Drivatars that can compete with friends.  This presentation
    will go behind the scenes in the development of Forza Drivatar, explaining the approach from a
    technical perspective as well as the design and integration with the gameplay.

- title: "Optimizing MCTS Performance for Tactical Coordination in TOTAL WAR: ATILLA"
  description: >
    This presentation focuses on an advanced AI search technique called Monte-Carlo Tree Search,
    and its improvements for the latest iteration of the TOTAL WAR franchise.  Introduced 
    previously in ROME 2, the tactical coordination system saw some major improvements to
    maximize the number of iterations executed without deteriorating performance.
    Piotr will dig into techniques that helped improve performance, for example in the
    structure of the tree itself as well as some higher-level optimisations.

- title: "Tactical Planning and Real-time MCTS in Fable Legends"
  description: >
    Fable Legends is a 4v1 asymetric multiplayer game, in which a team of 4 heroes compete against 1 villain. This poses some interesting design and programming challenges. Tactical decisions (e.g. revive a team mate or go for the objective) are not necessarily straight forward when there are a wide range of characters, abilities, constantly changing designs and different game modes. The aim was to create a robust tactical AI that could adapt to any situation and create interesting challenges for players. One that could come up with strategies on its own and surprise us as players. Rather than go a more traditional route (utility scoring, planners/HTN) we implemented a simulation based approach, which involved modelling the game play and using MCTS to search the potential plan space. Overall this worked well, has interesting characteristics and has a number of potential opportunities not readily available with other techniques (e.g. feeding in telemetry data, learning player behaviour, statistical analysis). Being able to update the model and have the system automatically find new strategies is very advantageous. This talk would be a deep dive of the implementation, challenges, performance and result as well as future plans.
