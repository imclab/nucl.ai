- title: "Spawn Trees — Inside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Communities"
  description: >
    When approaching The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt community module design, we knew that we needed a scalable system capable of powering everything from the large city of Novigrad, to a small woodcutter's hut in the middle of nowhere, to ancient catacombs filled with undead monsters. 
    It will be my privilege to talk about SpawnTrees, our internal system utilizing decision trees to define open world communities. I'll share with you the story of how we arrived at the current solution, what were the problems along the road, and how Spawn Trees worked with other AI systems. 
    Finally, we will take a broader and more general look on the usage of AI system design principles outside of NPC behavior.

- title: Epic AI Systems and Director in Fortnite
  description: >
    Fortnite is Epic Game's upcoming free-to-play title with fort building and an AI director that spawns procedural
    hordes of enemies towards the player.  In this talk, John will dig into the various systems that go into the game
    from both a technical and design perspective, and how they are being brought together into a coherent and fun
    experience!

- title: Building a Systemic Understanding of Systemic Design
  description: >
    Systemic design is for many of us like water to fish: we swim in it daily, but we have a difficult
    time articulating exactly what it is. This talk will provide useful, practical definitions of
    important concepts like systems, emergence, and interactivity. A cohesive framework for creating
    systems and systemic effects in game and AI design will also be presented.
    <ul>
      <li>Systems and system design are vital areas for games and simulations. And yet, terms like "systems," "emergence," and "interaction" remain ill-defined despite their broad use.</li> 
      <li>Come away from this talk with a clearer theoretical and practical understanding of these concepts to improve your ability to construct and recognize interactive systems.</li>

- title: "Coordinating Open World Systems and Emergent Gameplay (Expert Panel) **"
  description: >
    As new ideas emerge and hardware continues to evolve, the size and complexity of video game worlds are growing into vast 
    and rich environments.  2015 alone is filled with examples of such wide and expansive worlds from CD Projekt Red's 
    'Witcher 3: Wild Hunt' to Rocksteady's 'Batman: Arkham Knight'.  These worlds provide new affordances for player experience, 
    but present interesting challenges not only in creating AI systems that craft these experiences, but also in building the 
    environment to begin with.  Systemic design and the adoption of director systems can provide solutions across both of these 
    fronts, but there are many challenges still to be met.  In this panel we will discuss with a collection of our speakers from 
    the track the open challenges of the field and how AI can continue to innovate in this area.

# - title: "Designing CAD Tools for Novices: Can Algorithms Enhance productivity or foster creativity?"
#   description: >
#     Mixed-initiative design tools both support users in their design process (enhancing productivity) but also contribute with novel ideas (fostering creativity). 
#	  In the generation of such ideas, a mixed-initiative tool should recognize the user's intentions, aesthetic preferences and design process; suggesting either the next logical step 
#     towards the user's perceived goal or present an unexpected alternative which the designer hadn't thought of. 
#
#     This talk will cover mixed-initiative design where both human and computer proactively contribute to the problem solution. Furthermore , we will present methods for using and how Artificial Intelligence can assist a novice user 
#     in getting acquainted with task of designing, as well as automate the more tedious or challenging development tasks. 
#	  We will conclude with promising directions (and low-hanging fruit) for commercial tool development wishing 
#     to incorporate AI-assisted and mixed-initiative design paradigms.
#		<ul>
#			<li>Can intelligent CAD tools design game content with or without human collaborators, and what is the difference? </li>
#			<li>How do human designers react to proactive systems, and how can the CAD system minimize frustration and maximize output? </li>
#			<li>There are specific phases of development where AI can contribute to the creativity of a dev team.</li>
#			<li>Speeding up development during crunch does not need elaborate artificial intelligence; in contrast, fostering human creativity during brainstorming requires several layers or fine-tuned AI and UI.</li>
#			<li>Interface design of intelligent development tools is an ongoing balancing act between reducing a novice's cognitive load and increasing human users' control over created content.</li>

#- title: "Orchestration of virtual environments for training in complex sociotechnical situations"
#  description: >
#	 The talk will present the HUMANS platform (Human models based Artificial eNvironments Software platform): a system to orchestrate virtual environments for learning.  HUMANS generate these environments dynamically and without impairing the world coherency nor the emergence of new and unpredicted situations. 
#	 The HUMANS platform relies on the modelling of human and social activities leveraging highly complex artificial intelligence techniques such as knowledge representation, uncertainty processing and decisional artificial intelligence.
