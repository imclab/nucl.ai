- title: "Spawn Trees — Inside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Communities"
  description: >
    When approaching The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt community module design, we knew that we needed a scalable system capable of powering everything from the large city of Novigrad, to a small woodcutter's hut in the middle of nowhere, to ancient catacombs filled with undead monsters. 
    It will be my privilege to talk about SpawnTrees, our internal system utilizing decision trees to define open world communities. I'll share with you the story of how we arrived at the current solution, what were the problems along the road, and how Spawn Trees worked with other AI systems. 
    Finally, we will take a broader and more general look on the usage of AI system design principles outside of NPC behavior.

- title: Epic AI Systems and Director in Fortnite
  description: >
    Fortnite is Epic Game's upcoming free-to-play title with fort building and an AI director that spawns procedural
    hordes of enemies towards the player.  In this talk, John will dig into the various systems that go into the game
    from both a technical and design perspective, and how they are being brought together into a coherent and fun
    experience!

- title: Building a Systemic Understanding of Systemic Design
  description: >
    Systemic design is for many of us like water to fish: we swim in it daily, but we have a difficult
    time articulating exactly what it is. This talk will provide useful, practical definitions of
    important concepts like systems, emergence, and interactivity. A cohesive framework for creating
    systems and systemic effects in game and AI design will also be presented.

# - title: "Designing CAD Tools for Novices: Can Algorithms Enhance productivity or foster creativity?"
#   description: >
#     As the number and the size of computer games continues to expand, game companies handle rising demand by extending their cadre, 
#     compressing development cycles and reusing code or assets. To limit development time and reduce the cost of content creation, 
#     commercial game engines and procedural content generation are popular shortcuts among game companies. Low-level engine features 
#     such as physics simulation and game-independent content such as vegetation are often handled by third-party middleware. 
#     For content more contingent on a game's theme, mechanics and quests, most commercial game engines assist in the fast and intuitive 
#     creation of game levels and scripts via game editors which automate mundane tasks such as pathfinding. Computer-aided design tools 
#     are used in almost all creative tasks in order to minimize development time and cost, reduce human effort, support collaboration among 
#     members of a design team or elicit a user's creativity.
#     While computer-aided design tools are extending their functionalities to allow for the creation of more and more elaborate and complete games, 
#     the learning curve for a novice user becomes steeper. This talk will present methods for using Artificial Intelligence to assist a novice user 
#     in getting acquainted with the interface and the task of designing, as well as automate the more tedious or challenging development tasks. 
#     The talk will cover mixed-initiative design where both the human and the computer proactively contribute to the problem solution, although 
#     the two initiatives do not need to contribute to the same degree. Mixed-initiative design tools should both support a user in their design 
#     process (enhancing productivity) but also contribute with novel ideas (fostering creativity). In the generation of such ideas, a mixed-initiative 
#     tool should recognize the user's intentions, aesthetic preferences and design process; its suggestions should either be the next logical step 
#     towards the user's perceived goal or present an unexpected alternative which the designer hadn't thought of. In order to make either type of 
#     suggestion meaningful, the computer must be able to capture the user's perceptual and cognitive mechanisms, and apply this knowledge to incite 
#     the creativity of the designer. The talk will conclude with promising directions (and low-hanging fruit) for commercial tool development wishing 
#     to incorporate AI-assisted and mixed-initiative design paradigms.

#- title: "Orchestration of virtual environments for training in complex sociotechnical situations"
#  description: >
#    The current state-of-the-art on virtual environments allows us to envision their use for training purposes. 
#    We can conceive autonomous worlds where learners can experiment, discover and learn the outcomes of their decisions. 
#    Though, it is important that this autonomy stay manageable to achieve pedagogical relevance and coherency of the world.

#    The talk will present the HUMANS platform (Human models based Artificial eNvironments Software platform) whose purpose is
#    to dynamically orchestrate a virtual environment towards learning situations without impairing the world coherency nor the
#    emergence of new and unpredicted situations. The HUMANS platform relies on the modelling of human and social activities
#    leveraging highly complex artificial intelligence techniques in various domains, such as knowledge representation (ontologies),
#    uncertainty processing in complex systems and decisional artificial intelligence (automated planning, plan recognition, multiagent systems).
