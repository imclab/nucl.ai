- title: "The Evolution of Crowds and AI in Feature Film Animation"
  description: >
    At Pixar, crowds are important because they provide spectacle, make worlds more realistic and react believably to the 
    character’s action. But they’re also hard to do! So if you want to know more about how Pixar Animation Studios created 
    crowds for Cars 2, Ratatouille and Up, Paul's talk will lead you through crowd pipelines for feature films, highlighting AI 
    usages in service of Animation.

- title: "Building the Massive Crowds of Assassin’s Creed Unity"
  description: >
    With the limit of 40 real AIs and 120 high resolution models, we could create scenes in Assassin’s Creed Unity where 10000 
    crowd NPCs are on screen at the same time. In this presentation, we will introduce a new technique of AI Level of Detail 
    that has allowed us to create thousands of replicated, persistent, interactive NPCs at very low cost. We will go over how 
    we created a pooling system that allowed us to swap a small number of legacy NPC with cheap low resolution NPCs without the 
    player noticing. This talk will then explain how to create a simplistic AI brain to handle the behavior systems of the cheap 
    NPCs. We will also give insights on the problems that came with integrating this technology in a huge legacy system.

- title: "Crowds Patches for Populating Virtual Worlds"
  description: >
    We traverse virtual worlds more and more often. Their size is always getting larger, up to the entire earth in the eaxmple 
    of virtual globes. Populating such virtual worlds remain a difficult challenge. Populating virtual cities like Los Santos 
    (GTA V) raise huge design, animation and coding efforts. Crowd simulations systems are generally used in such contexts, 
    and raise many difficulties for their users. In this talk, we present the crowd patches solution to populate large virtual 
    environments. Crowd patches are sort 3D animated textures which capture elements of precomputed crowd animations. Internal 
    animation trajectories are computed so that they periodic in time and have controlled boundary conditions. This way, 
    patches can be assembled together to form large animation, while their content can be endlessly played in loops thanks to 
    periodicity. In the computational point of view, animation costs are reduced to data replay. The talk we put into evidence 
    that the main difficulty when using crowd patches is the way to compute internal trajectories, that have to pass through 
    sets of spatiotemporal waypoints to satisfy some imposed boundary conditions. The talk will also demonstrate that, beyond 
    those difficulties, crowd patches offer opportunities for designers to design crowd animations and to populate virtual 
    places according to new paradigms, high level control, without need of expertise on crowd animation systems.

- title: "Believable and Responsive Locomotion for Simulated Agents"
  description: >
    Creating believable and responsive locomotion animation for simulated agents is a common problem for small indie projects 
    as well as large productions. In this presentation we will take a peek at recent R&D from Unity where we have explored a 
    solution to the locomotion animation problem. The talk will take a close look at both the velocity based obstacle avoidance 
    as well as parametric animation controller to find a common interface. We will propose a method that can be quickly set up 
    for a small project with limited resources, and allows fine tuning for better quality animation.
