- title: "Multi-Kinect Motion Tracking and Interactive Installations"
  description: >
    <p>What goes into creating a multi-user multi-Kinect interactive installation to convey a somewhat abstract message, other than blood, sweat, and a lot of development time?</p>
    <p>I’ll discuss the process, our use of both open-source and off-the-shelf AI libraries, as well as when we roll our own. I’ll go over the challenges of building them, with a distributed team, with fuzzy design requirements to convey even fuzzier concepts, and against fixed and very tight deadlines.</p>

  description: >
    <p>As goggle-based AR slowly matures, there's a window of opportunity for projector-based AR experiences.  It's also a great way to learn about the technology and the impacts on design required to pull off augmented reality in practice &mdash; with a setup that works reliably now already!</p>
    <p>This short tutorial about <a href="http://project-trains.tumblr.com/">Project Trains</a> will show some of the biggest lessons learned from building an interactive living room experience from two kids, from the computer vision aspect to the crafting (litterally) of a projector-based experience with augmented toy tracks.</p>
