    <h2>Event Overview</h2>

    <grid>
        <content>
            <p>Generally speaking, <a href="/">nucl.ai</a> is made up of nine day-long tracks on specific topics, with three running in parallel each day over three days.  The current topics are as follows, and will be finalized by the first week of May when single-day tickets become available:</p>
            <div class="thumbnails small-tracks">
                {% include page/tracks/header.html %}
            </div>

            <p>Each of these tracks consists of an inspiring keynote and/or presentations from high-profile applications, specialized masterclasses and in-depth tutorials, panel discussions and expert Q&amp;A, and (if applicable) an open laboratory in workshop-style.  The different types of sessions are scheduled in different rooms throughout the day.</p>

            <p class="message">IMPORTANT: Those of you that attended the <a href="http://gameaiconf.com/">Game/AI Conference</a> or Workshops in their previous iterations will find the same experience over three days in one of the rooms described below...</p>

    <h2>Main Amphitheatre</h2>

            <item class="text">
                <p>The upper room at the University of Vienna's "Hörsaalzentrum" will host hundreds of attendees over three days, and is the equivalent to the Game/AI Conference's previous six editions.  Drawing from a rotation of <a href="http://nucl.ai/#topics">all event tracks</a>, multiple types of talks will be featured there:</p>

                    <li><b>Inspiring &amp; Insightful Keynotes</b></li>

                <p>If you consider the main amphitheatre in the context of the classic AI dilemma of "exploration" vs. "exploitation" then this room is Exploration!</p>

                <p>The lower room at the University of Vienna's "Hörsaalzentrum" will host a limited number of our best looking and smartest conference attendees!
